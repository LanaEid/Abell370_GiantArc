# Abell370_GiantArc
Graduate research project - gravitational lensing - giant arcs - Abell 370 - Hubble Frontier Fields - using lensmodel/pixsrc
Local copy of personal code for use as a backup.  
I have mainly used this notebook for understanding lens models for galaxy clusters in the Hubble Frontier Fields from my research group's previous research (last half)
as well as preparing data/science images for use with lensmodel (Keeton, 2001)/pixsrc (Tagore & Keeton, 2014) (PSF measurement and galaxy masking, first half).
